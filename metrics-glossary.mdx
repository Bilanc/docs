## Pull Request Metrics

### Merged PRs
The total number of pull requests that have been successfully merged into the default branch during the selected time period.

### Productivity Score
An AI-generated score (0â€“100) that estimates the relative effort and complexity involved in completing each pull request. This is calculated using contextual metadata (code changes, issue data, etc.) and LLM-based analysis. Learn more about how we calculate the Productivity Score [here](https://www.bilanc.co/blog/how-do-we-measure-engineering-productivity).

### Total Lines of Code
The net number of lines of code added, modified, or deleted across all merged pull requests. This includes both additions and deletions.

### Cycle Time
The duration between when a pull request is opened and when it is merged. This reflects how long it takes for code to move from draft to production-ready.

### Review Time
The time taken between the first review comment and the final merge of the PR. This measures how quickly PRs are reviewed once submitted.

### Review Rate
The percentage of pull requests that received a code review before being merged. A key signal of collaborative development and code quality checks.

### Merge Frequency
The number of pull requests merged per engineer (or per team) per day. It reflects how frequently changes are being integrated into the main branch.

## Deployment Metrics

### Deployment Frequency
How often new changes are deployed to production. This is tracked using deployment metadata from your CI/CD pipelines.

## PR Categorization

### PR Categories
Each pull request is automatically classified using an LLM into one of the following categories:

- **Bug Fixes** â€“ Code changes that resolve bugs or errors.
- **Tech Improvements** â€“ Refactors, performance optimizations, dependency upgrades, or infrastructure changes.
- **Feature Work** â€“ Code that implements new user-facing functionality or business logic.

### State
The current status of the PR: Open, Merged, or Closed.

### PR Opened At
The timestamp of when the pull request was initially created.

### PR Merged At
The timestamp of when the pull request was successfully merged.
