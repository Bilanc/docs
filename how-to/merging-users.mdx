## Overview

When integrating with multiple data sources like GitHub and JIRA, it's common for the same engineer to appear under different identities. Our platform allows you to merge these into a single, unified profile.

## Why Merge Users?

## Steps to Merge Users

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Users Page">
    Go to **Admin â†’ Users**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the Users to Merge">
    Use the checkboxes to select multiple user entries that belong to the same person.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click on Merging Actions">
    Open the dropdown labeled **Merging Actions**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Merge">
    Select the **Merge** option from the dropdown
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm the Merge">
    You may be asked to confirm the merge action.
    
    Once confirmed, the selected users will be combined into one engineer profile.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How Does Merging Work?

Merging consolidates identities from multiple sources (e.g., GitHub, JIRA) under a single engineer. All activity, tickets, PRs, and metrics will be aggregated accordingly.

<Accordion title="Technical Details">
  When users are merged:
  - All historical data is recalculated for the unified profile
  - Integration source mappings are updated
  - Unique IDs from each platform are preserved for data integrity
</Accordion>

## Unmerging Users

If you merged by mistake, you can reverse the action:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the merged profile">
    Navigate to the merged user profile
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Merging Actions">
    Open the dropdown menu
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Unmerge">
    Confirm the unmerge action
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Need Help?

If you're unsure which users to merge, or if something doesn't look right, [contact support](mailto:support@bilanc.co) or refer to our [troubleshooting guide](/essentials/troubleshooting).

<Tip>
  **Best Practice**: Before merging users in a production environment, we recommend testing on a small subset of users first to ensure data accuracy.
