## What Happens After Import?

Once your Cursor data is imported:

- AI usage metrics will appear in your dashboards
- Developer productivity with AI will be calculated
- The data will be merged with other connected tools for comprehensive insights

<Accordion title="Data Refresh">
  Cursor data is not automatically refreshed. For the most up-to-date metrics, we recommend re-importing your Cursor data on a regular schedule (weekly or monthly).

## Troubleshooting
