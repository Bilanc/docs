## Metrics Endpoint Structure

All metrics endpoints follow the same base structure:

**Endpoint:** `POST /metrics/v2/{metric_type}`

**Authentication Required:** Yes

**Path Parameters:**

- `metric_type` (string, required): The type of metric to retrieve. See available metric types below.

## Common Request Parameters

Most metric endpoints accept the following request parameters:

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2"
  },
  "group_by": ["field1", "field2"],
  "date_level": "day|week|month|quarter|year",
  "aggregation": "sum|avg|count|etc",
  "metric_min_value": 0,
  "date_field": "created_at|merged_at|etc",
  "time_series_data": false,
  "include_previous_period": false
}
```

### Parameter Details

<ResponseField name="filters" type="object">

<ResponseField name="include_previous_period" type="boolean">
  Whether to include data from the previous time period for comparison. Default: `false`
</ResponseField>

## Response Format

The response format depends on the requested metric and parameters. By default, the API returns a JSON object with the requested metric data:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "metric_name": "pull-requests-count",
      "value": 42,
      "group_by": {
        "repository_name": "my-repository"
      }
    },
    {
      "metric_name": "pull-requests-count",
      "value": 18,
      "group_by": {
        "repository_name": "another-repository"
      }
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "filters": {
      "start_date": "2023-01-01",
      "end_date": "2023-12-31"
    },
    "date_range": {
      "start_date": "2023-01-01",
      "end_date": "2023-12-31"
    }
  }
}
```

If `time_series_data` is set to `true`, the response will be formatted for line chart visualization:

```json
{
  "series": [
    {
      "name": "my-repository",
      "data": [4, 8, 12, 10, 8]
    },
    {
      "name": "another-repository",
      "data": [2, 4, 5, 4, 3]
    }
  ],
  "categories": ["Jan 2023", "Feb 2023", "Mar 2023", "Apr 2023", "May 2023"],
  "meta": {
    "filters": {
      "start_date": "2023-01-01",
      "end_date": "2023-05-31"
    },
    "date_range": {
      "start_date": "2023-01-01",
      "end_date": "2023-05-31"
    }
  }
}
```
