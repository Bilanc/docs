## Development Metrics

Development metrics focus on the time spent in different phases of the development process, helping teams understand and optimize their development workflow.

### Available Metrics

<ParamField path="coding-time" type="string">
  Time spent coding
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="pickup-time" type="string">
  Time between commit and PR open
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="commit-to-open" type="string">
  Time from commit to PR open
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="reviews-count" type="string">
  Number of reviews
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="open-to-review" type="string">
  Time between PR open and first review
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="review-to-merge" type="string">
  Time between first review and merge
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="review-time" type="string">
  Total time spent in review
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="rework-time" type="string">
  Time spent on rework after review
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="cycle-time" type="string">
  Full cycle time from commit to merge
</ParamField>

## Cycle Time Metric

This example demonstrates how to retrieve the cycle time metric, which measures the full development cycle from initial commit to merge.

```bash Request
curl -X POST 'https://api.bilanc.co/metrics/v2/cycle-time' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

  }'
```

```json Response

## Review Time Metric

This example demonstrates how to retrieve the review time metric, which measures the total time spent in the review phase.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
curl -X POST 'https://api.bilanc.co/metrics/v2/review-time' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "filters": {
      "team_id": "team123",
      "start_date": "2023-01-01",
      "end_date": "2023-12-31"
    },
    "group_by": ["team_name"],
    "date_level": "month",
    "aggregation": "avg"
  }'
```

```json Response
{
  "results": [
    {
      "metric_name": "review-time",
      "value": 8.5,
      "group_by": {
        "team_name": "Backend Team"
      }
    },
    {
      "metric_name": "review-time",
      "value": 6.2,
      "group_by": {
        "team_name": "Frontend Team"
      }
    },
    {
      "metric_name": "review-time",
      "value": 9.7,
      "group_by": {
        "team_name": "Infrastructure Team"
      }
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "filters": {
      "team_id": "team123",
      "start_date": "2023-01-01",
      "end_date": "2023-12-31"
    },
    "date_range": {
      "start_date": "2023-01-01",
      "end_date": "2023-12-31"
    },
    "unit": "hours"
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Parameter Notes

<ResponseField name="date_field" type="string">
  For development metrics, the following date fields are available:
  - `created_at`: For metrics related to the creation time
  - `merged_at`: For metrics related to the merge time (best for cycle time)
  - `first_review_at`: For metrics related to review time
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="aggregation" type="string">
  For time-based metrics, the following aggregations are recommended:
  - `avg`: Average time (most common)
  - `median`: Median time (reduces impact of outliers)
  - `p90`: 90th percentile (shows worst-case scenarios)
</ResponseField>

## Common Use Cases

- **Track Cycle Time Trends**: Monitor how development cycle time changes over time
- **Identify Bottlenecks**: Find which part of the development process takes the longest
- **Compare Team Performance**: Compare cycle times across different teams or repositories
- **Set Performance Goals**: Establish baseline metrics and set improvement goals
