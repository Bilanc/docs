## Infrastructure Components

Bilancâ€™s infrastructure comprises several core services, each responsible for a specific layer of the platform:

- **API Server (FastAPI)**: Serves as the primary API gateway.  
- **Dashboard (Next.js)**: Renders interactive analytics and visualizations.  
- **Workflow Orchestrator (Dagster)**: Schedules and executes data pipelines.  
- **Task Queue (Celery)**: Handles asynchronous background jobs at scale.  
- **Message Broker (Redis)**: Acts as the message broker for Celery tasks.  
- **Primary Database (PostgreSQL)**: Persists application state, user data, and analytics.

## Cloud vs. self-hosted architecture

The Bilanc architecture is largely the same for both Cloud and Self-hosting. This ensures self-hosted instances benefit from continous dog-fooding and load-testing.

## Email service

Bilanc uses Resend exclusively for emails.

For self-hosted instances, you can configure your own API key
