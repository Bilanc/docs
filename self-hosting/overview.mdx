Bilanc offers a self-hosted deployment option for customers who need full control over their infrastructure. This guide covers deployment, scaling, updates, and other key operational details.

## Features
All paid features available on Bilanc Cloud are included in the Enterprise self-hosted edition.

## Plan requirement
A Bilanc subscription is required.

## Intended users
Optimised for large, regulated enterprises.

## Deployment
By default, Bilanc is deployed as a Docker image. We could explore other deployent options (e.g. Helm charts) if required.

## Updates
Updates are distributed via versioned Docker images. A staging environment is recommended to test updates before production.

Update cadence is flexible based on your needs.

## Cloud provider support
Bilanc is cloud acgnostic. Supports all major cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure).

## Infrastructure components
See the detailed infrastructure components [here](infrastructure)

## Recommended configuration
- **5 services** (API, Dashboard, Orchestrator Webserver, Orchestrator Daemon, Celery): 1 CPU, 2GB RAM per service
- **Postgres database**: 2 CPU, 8GB RAM, 128GB storage
- **Redis data store**: 128MB

## Scaling
Auto-scaling is not provided out-of-the-box yet, but the default configuration scales far. We can guide you on configuring auto-scaling when needed.

Bottlenecks mostly depend on:
- Data Transformation: solved by scaling Postgres vertically.

## Data Storage
- Postgres: Persists application state, user data, and analytics.

## Using existing data stores
- Bilanc is flexible with data store setups. However, we recommend a separate instance for independent scaling.

## Internet Access Requirments
- API: Required for pulling Team information from GitHub
- Orchestrator: Required for data ingestion from the data sources
